  Linear and Logistic Regression Project
Introduction
This project explores Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, two fundamental machine learning algorithms widely used for predictive modeling.

*Linear Regression is applied when the target variable is continuous and the relationship between variables is assumed to be linear.
*Logistic Regression is used when the target variable is categorical, typically binary, to estimate the probability of a class label.

Both techniques are crucial in statistical learning and help in making predictions and drawing inferences from datasets.
