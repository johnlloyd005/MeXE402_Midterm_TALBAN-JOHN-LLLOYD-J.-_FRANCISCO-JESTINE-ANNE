# Linear and Logistic Regression Analysis

## 1. Introduction

### Overview of Linear Regression:
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to find a linear equation that best predicts the dependent variable from the independent variables. This method assumes a linear relationship between the variables and minimizes the error (residual sum of squares) between observed and predicted values.

Applications of linear regression include predicting continuous outcomes such as prices, temperatures, or other measurable quantities.

### Overview of Logistic Regression:
Logistic regression, unlike linear regression, is used for binary or categorical outcome prediction. Instead of predicting a continuous value, it estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class, typically by using a logistic function to model the data. The output is a probability score between 0 and 1, which is later classified into one of the two classes based on a threshold value (e.g., 0.5).

Logistic regression is often used for classification tasks such as spam detection, disease diagnosis, or churn prediction.
